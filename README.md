The breast cancer subtype deficient in estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (ER-/HER2-) displays enhanced aggressiveness, metastasis and disease relapse due to chemoresistance. ER-/HER2- patients lack molecularly targeted treatment and upon treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs show poor prognosis. Hence, new therapeutic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers are required for better patient management. In this study, we investigated potential prognostic and predictive value of protein tyrosine phosphatases in breast cancer chemoresistance and disease recurrence.
